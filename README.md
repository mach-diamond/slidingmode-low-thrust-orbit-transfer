# orbit-transfer

This simulation is in partial fullfillment for the EP707 course on non-linear controls taught by [Dr. Sergey Drakunov](https://faculty.erau.edu/Sergey.Drakunov). A user can input a set of orbital parameters as boundary conditions, configure a set of spacecraft parameters, and run the simulation to find a solution to control the spacecraft to the desired trajectory.

# Requirements
